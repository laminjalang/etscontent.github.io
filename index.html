Kofax TotalAgility®  Bridge systems of engagement and systems of record to optimize customer experience, reduce operating costs, and streamline decision-making
Kofax Capture (KC) is a powerful production level capture platform. It captures information from virtually any source: scanner, multi-function printer, print stream, email, fax, web service or folder. Kofax Capture is available in an enterprise edition that offers high availability and disaster recovery for mission critical implementations.
 
Kofax Capture Network Server (KCNS) extends the capabilities of Kofax Capture by securely connecting Kofax Capture remote systems. Batches can be scanned and processed at the remote offices, and then uploaded to the central site for further processing and export to a content repository like SharePoint website.. KCNS eliminates the common and costly practice of shipping documents from remote offices to a central site for processing. 

Kofax Transformation Modules (KTM)Automatically classify, separate, and extract data from any document to reduce labor costs and accelerate business processes. 
Kofax Analytics for Capture (KAFC) provides optimized out-of-the-box dashboards focused on elevating the visibility into the production scanning operations. More importantly, KAFC delivers interactive views into staff performance and recognition accuracy. It allows production operations managers to report on the effectiveness of their capture solution and improve overall system throughput.
